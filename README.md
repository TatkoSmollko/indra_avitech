This repository contains the implementation of a coding assignment using Hexagonal Architecture (also known as Ports and Adapters). The application is designed with a strong focus on maintainability, separation of concerns, and testability.

Key features:

- Hexagonal Architecture for clear separation between domain logic and infrastructure
- Unit and integration tests written using JUnit
- Flyway is used for managing database migrations and schema setup
- Embedded or external database support via configurable DataSource

The project demonstrates clean code practices, test-driven development, and modular design principles.
